# Lab 4 - DC Motor Control using Digital PID Control

In this lab, you will complete a series of tasks designed to familiarize you with the concepts of **Digital PID Control**. You will use a PID controller to control the position of a DC motor and observe its behavior under various parameter settings. This lab provides hands-on experience in tuning PID parameters to achieve optimal motor control performance.

## Key Concepts:
- **PID Control**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control is a widely used feedback control mechanism in automation and control systems. By adjusting the **Proportional (P)**, **Integral (I)**, and **Derivative (D)** parameters, you can fine-tune the controller for precise and stable motor position control.
- **DC Motor Control**: The position of the motor is adjusted using the feedback loop implemented by the PID controller, based on the error between the desired and actual positions.

## Tips for Parameter Tuning:
- **Proportional (P)**: Determines the response to the current error. A higher value increases responsiveness but can cause oscillations.  
  - Recommended Range: **1 to 10**  
  - Example: Set P to a high value, such as **7 or 8**.
- **Integral (I)**: Addresses accumulated error over time. Too high a value can lead to overshooting.  
  - Recommended Range: **0 to 3**  
  - Example: Set I to a low value, such as **1 or 1.5**.
- **Derivative (D)**: Reduces overshooting by predicting future errors based on the rate of change.  
  - Recommended Range: **0 to 3**  
  - Example: Set D to a low value, such as **1 or 1.5**.

## Tasks:
1. Implement a PID controller to regulate the position of a DC motor.  
2. Experiment with different PID parameter values to observe the motor's response.  
3. Analyze the effects of varying P, I, and D parameters on system stability and performance.

## Observations:
- **High P values** increase responsiveness but may lead to oscillations.
- **Low I values** help eliminate steady-state errors without introducing excessive overshoot.
- **Low D values** stabilize the system by dampening oscillations.

## Conclusion:
By completing this lab, you will gain a deeper understanding of PID control and its practical application in motor control systems. Experimenting with different parameter values will provide insights into the trade-offs between responsiveness, stability, and precision, equipping you with essential skills for designing and optimizing control systems.
