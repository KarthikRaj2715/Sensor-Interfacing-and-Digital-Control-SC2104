# SC2104: Sensor Interfacing and Digital Control

This repository contains laboratory exercises for the SC2104: Sensor Interfacing and Digital Control module. Each lab focuses on key aspects of embedded systems, sensor integration, and control techniques, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Lab Descriptions

### **Lab 1: Introduction to STM32Cube IDE and Basic Peripherals**
This lab provides an introduction to navigating the STM32Cube IDE software while utilizing hardware components such as:
- **Buzzer**: Generating sound signals for notifications.
- **OLED Display**: Displaying visual output on a low-power screen.
- **Ultrasound Sensor**: Measuring distances using ultrasonic technology.

### **Lab 2: IMU Sensors - Accelerometer and Gyroscope**
Focuses on retrieving data from Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors, specifically:
- **Accelerometer**: Measuring linear motion.
- **Gyroscope**: Measuring angular velocity.
The lab also demonstrates how to visualize sensor data using SerialPlot software.

### **Lab 3: Sensor Fusion**
Explores sensor fusion techniques to combine accelerometer and gyroscope data for calculating roll and pitch angles using:
- **Complementary Filter**
- **Kalman Filter**
The lab compares the performance of these two approaches.

### **Lab 4: DC Motor Control with PID**
Covers the implementation of digital PID control for DC motor position control. This lab provides insights into:
- Understanding PID parameters (Proportional, Integral, Derivative).
- Observing motor behaviour under different parameter settings.

### **Lab 5: Self-Leveling Platform**
Integrates concepts and techniques from Labs 1-3 to create a self-leveling platform. This project highlights the application of sensor interfacing and control mechanisms in a comprehensive system.
